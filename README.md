Today marks the 1000th day of my commit streak here on GitHub. Although that in itself means nothing, it feels like a fitting moment to reevaluate my choice of platform. When I first started using GitHub, it was nice, but now, it feels like they value money more than the developers actually using their platform.

I take issue with them training their AI on code *without permission from the authors*, and then forcing it on you at every opportunity they get. Also, GitHub is owned by Microsoft, a company which I don't particularly like. Additionally, they're US-based, and with rising geopolitical tension, I'm not super eager to host my code there.

That's why I'm hosting my own, private GitLab instance here in Europe. This way, I can have full control, face fewer limitations, and even spend less than I would on GitHub's Pro plan. *(I also just enjoy learning new things and hosting my own infrastructure)*

That being said, my public repositories will still be available here. GitHub is still the most used developer platform, which, sadly, makes it almost a requirement to use for small open-source projects.

_Goodbye, GitHub._
